Goal:
====

To create an interactive map of the biblical genealogy from
Adam to Jesus. Hovering over each character will give you
a number of quickfacts about him/her (ie: spouses, siblings,
scripture references, etc.)

Obstacles:
==========
- Input order isn't linear (Genealogies scattered throughout Bible)
- Some people have different names (Jacob -> Israel)
- Some people have numerous wives, sort children
  by their mothers? (Rachel & Leah)
